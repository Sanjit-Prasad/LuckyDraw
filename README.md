* A cron_job will run everyday at 8AM which will compute the winner using API 'find_winner'.
* The job will also resets the users (ticket_id) and tikets (used) data.
* The same users can participate in next event and we can use the same ticket from database.

# 3. Design an API which allows users to participate in the game. Once a user has participated with a raffle ticket, she shouldnâ€™t be able to participate again in the same event.

* First we check if user has any ticket left in their account

* Then user can participate by click on "Participate" button for any active events
* A user can participate in multiple active events
* On successful participation we decrease ticket count by 1

* We also check if user has already participated in same event

# 4. Design an API which lists all the winners of all the events in the last one week.

* Our API will show all the events past one week

* User can click on "Show List" button to see all the winners

# 5. Compute the winner for the event and announce the winner.

* We have made a CronJob which will run everyday at 8:00 AM. The task of the job is to run the "RewardWorker" to compute the winner for all the active events that are finished on current date.
