* List of rewards for any Active event

# 3. Design an API which allows users to participate in the game. Once a user has participated with a raffle ticket, she shouldnâ€™t be able to participate again in the same event.

* First we check if user has any ticket left in their account, if not we won't allow participation

* Then user can participate by click on "Participate" button for any active events
* A user can participate in multiple active events

* On successful participation we decrease ticket count by 1
* We also check if user has already participated in the event

# 4. Design an API which lists all the winners of all the events in the last one week.

* We have made an API will show all the "Finished Events" for the past week

![alt text](https://github.com/Sanjit-Prasad/LuckyDraw/blob/main/images/4.1.png?raw=true)


* A user can click on "Show List" button to see all the winners for that event below

# 5. Compute the winner for the event and announce the winner.

* We have made a CronJob which will run everyday at 8:00 AM.
* The task of the sidekiq-scheduler job is to run the "RewardWorker" which then computes the winner for all the events that are finished on current date.

* Sidekiq Job Scheduler
